# py_hk
Python scripts to facilitate the running of H-kappa receiver function package
The goal of these loosely written python scripts is to streamline the data acquisition, processing and other preparation steps for running the H-Kappa receiver function package.

While I continue to work on the package, feel free to get a test of the code by running
main_hkrec.py
